Try making a Dockerfile to run the mc_potts script for generating simulations!

To build: docker build -t potts-cli:test .
To run: docker run --rm potts-cli:test <params> > results.txt

Try to make your own dockerfile, but if you get stuck, you can look at the solutions. Dockerfile-solution-minimal builds an image with only a couple lines, but ignores some good practices. Dockerfile-solution-better builds an image that incorporates several additional improvements.
